<h1>The Misconception Behind Sharks</h1>
<p>There are about 465 different recorded species of sharks. They come in all different shapes and sizes and have adapted to living in many different aquatic habitats. At any given time, anywhere in the world’s ocean, there is always the possibility of spotting a shark. This fact alone has terrified people for hundreds of years as sharks are considered by most to be very dangerous and scary creatures. Many people tend to think of them more as monsters than animals.  </p>

      <h2>Why Is This?</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>There are many reasons that people see these creatures in such a monsterly manner. A massive contribution to this issue is ignorance. When people think of sharks they imagine the speed, strength, and teeth, but most people dont actually know much about these animals and their behaviors. Another massive contribution to this misconception is the way they are portryaed in cinema, paritcularly in horror movies like Jaws, 47 meters down, open water, etc. Sharks are apex predators that exist in a world completely out of our element. Movies like the ones mentioned use this fact to create an overwhelming sense of suspense, panic and fear around these creatures. Most people have subconsciously learned to fear sharks deeply, when in reality there is a better chance of getting hit by lightning than being attacked by one. </p>

    <h1>The Big Three</h1>
<p>Bull sharks, Tiger sharks and Great White sharks, aka "the big three" are the most notorious sharks on the planet and considered to be the most dangerous. It is these three species that account for half of all known shark attacks in history. If you hear about a shark attack, it most likely involved one of these three species. </p>

  <h1>bull Sharks</h1>
  <p>As of 2016, Bull Sharks were responsible for over 100 recorded attacks on humans, with 27 leading to fatalities. They average 11 feet and 700 lbs and are known to be agressive, swift and powerful hunters, unlikely to back down from conflict like many other animals. </p>
  </section>

  <section id="section8">
  <h1>Tiger Sharks</h1>
  <p>As of 2016, Tiger Sharks are responsible for 111 attacks on humans with 31 leading to fatalities. They grow between 11 and 13 feet and can weigh up to 1400 lbs. These skilled hunters are known as the garbage cans of the sea as they will literally eat anything. </p>
  </section>

  <section id="section9">
  <h1>Great White Sharks</h1>
  <p>As of 2016, Great White Sharks were responsible for 314 attacks on humans with 30 leading to fatalities. They average an impressive 16 feet and 1700 lbs. These animals have the strongest bite force of any known predator on Earth. This makes them the most dangerous recorded animal in the ocean towards humans.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="section10">
  <h1>What motivates the "big Three"? </h1>
  <p>These are three of the biggest and strongest recorded species of sharks. With all of these intimidating facts piled up it is easy for one to label them as monsters. However, it is important to understand the reasons behind these animals' behavior. It would be a mistake to assume their histoy of human attacks was caused by an over aggressive nature. The truth is a little more complex. Both Bullsharks and Tigersharks usually hunt in warm and shallow waters, which are often frequented by humans. Tigersharks also have such a diverse appetite, they often bite humans out of curiosity. Great White Sharks, with very poor vision, are also prone to biting out of curiosity. These animals only have their mouths to investigate their environment and it is only a problem because of how powerful they are.   </p>
  </section>

  <section id="section3">
<h1>Who Cares?</h1>
<p>People don't often consider the impact that such a misconception can have on different shark species all over the world. The problem isn't just that people see them as dangerous and scary, but the way they are treated as a result. Up to 100 million sharks are killed every year by human beings. That's about 11,000 every hour. This is mainly done for their fins which are used to create shark fin soup, a delicacy in many places, particularly Asian countries. It is also done in order to make certain areas safer for swimming.
    Shark populations are dropping rapidly and the severity of this issue needs to be understood. Sharks are at the top of their food chain and for this reason they play a crucial role in regulating the ecosystems they belong to. They not only control population sizes, but are prone to hunting old, weak or sick prey, a behavior which improves different species via natural selection. If shark populations continue to drop at this rate hundreds if not thousands of aquatic species could be lost, creating devastating effects on the ocean’s ecosystems.</p>
